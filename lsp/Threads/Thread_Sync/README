Producer Consumer Problem Examples:
----------------------------------
Example1: producerconsumer1.c (producer consumer problem using Pthreads only)
----------------------------
This is basic producer consumer example implement with pthreads with out synchronizaion mechanisums.
Draback: Data inconsistency, Data Loss, Dead Lock.

Example2: producerconsumer2.c (producer consumer problem using Pthreads and counting semaphores)
----------------------------
This example implement 2 counting semaphores one is empty and another one is full. This examples works fine if one producer and one consumer.
Drawback: Doesn't works Multiple Producers.

Example3: producerconsumer3.c (producer consumer problem using Pthreads, semaphores and Mutex)
-----------------------------
This example implement mutex for supporting multiple producers.
