pipe1.c    -  A program that uses the function pipe to create a pipe.

pipe2.c    -  A program that passes data between the two halves of a forked process using pipe.

pipe3.c    -  A program that uses the functions fork and execl to create a child process and then
uses the function pipe to pass data from one to the other.

pipe4.c    -  The child process called by execl in pipe3.c.

pipe5.c    -  A program that uses a pipe between the standard output and input of two processes.

fifo1.c    -  A program that creates a named pipe using fifo.

fifo2.c    -  A program that can be used to investigate the nature of fifo files by using open.

fifo3.c, fifo4.c  -  Two programs that show how to pass data between unrelated processes using a fifo.
