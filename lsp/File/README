File operations Examples:
---------------------------
1. write1.c - A program that uses write system call with proper ERROR Handling.

2. read1.c - A program that uses read system call with proper ERROR Handling.

3. open1.c - A program that reads a "abc" file content and writes in to stadard output.

	open1.c = $ cat abc
	open1.c != $ cat 123

4. copy_system.c  - A program that uses low-level system calls to copy one file to another.
	$ TIMEFORMAT=”” time copy_system

	11.32sec ; 99%cpu
5. copy_block.c  -  An improved version of system.c that copies blocks of data between the files.

	$ TIMEFORMAT=”” time copy_block
	0.02sec ; 50%cpu

6. copy_stdio.c  -  A program uses library calls to further improve the speed of the above programs by buffering
the file input and output.
	$ TIMEFORMAT=”” time copy_stdio
	0.03 sec; 59% cpu

7. lseek.c - A program that uses lseek system call.

8. stat.c - A Program that shows file information. 
	stat.c = ls -l

Mini Project -  File Operations:
-------------------------------
Project 1 : mycat.c - A program that works same as cat command line application.

1. implement command line arguments
2. proper error handling  

Project 2: mycp.c 

Origional copy command behavior:
-------------------------------
case 1: with out any arguments
------
$ cp
cp: missing file operand
Try 'cp --help' for more information.

case 2: one argument 
------
$ cp abc
cp: missing destination file operand after ‘abc’
Try 'cp --help' for more information.

case 3: two arguments - both are regular files
------
3a: source file name 123 is exist in current directory.
$ cat 123
kernelmasters
$ cp 123 abc
$ cat abc
kernelmasters

3b: source file name 123 is not exist in current directory.
$ cp 123 abc
cp: cannot stat ‘123’: No such file or directory

case 4: two arguments - source file is regular, destination is directory
------
$ cp abc test

case 5: threee arguments - all arguemnts are regular files
------
$ cp abc 123 xyz
cp: target ‘xyz’ is not a directory

case 6: threee arguments - last argument is directory 
------
$ cp abc 123 test

case 7: three arguemnts - last argument is home directory 
------
$ cp abc 123 ~/test
