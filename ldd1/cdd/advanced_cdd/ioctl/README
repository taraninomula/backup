Advanced Character Drivers:
--------------------------

IOCTL:

Most drivers need in addition to the ability to read and write the device the ability to perform various types of hardware control via the device driver. 

These operations are normally supported via the ioctl method.

In the user space, the ioctl command has the following format
int ioctl(int fd, unsigned long cmd, ...);

The ioctl driver method has the prototype
int (*ioctl) (struct inode *inode, struct file *filp, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg);


Magic Numbers:
Magic numbers are mechanisms of identifying the commands for a particular device. They must be unique over the system.
These are maintained by the kernel in 4 bit-fields.

1. type: This is the magic number present in the file ioctl-number.txt. It is 8 bits wide
2. number: The ordinal (sequential) number. It is also 8 bits wide
3. direction: The direction of data transfer. Two bits
4. size: The size of the user data involved. The size is architecture dependent, and is generally limited to 13 or 14 bits


To choose ioctl numbers for your driver according to the Linux kernel convention, you should first check include/asm/ioctl.h
and Documentation/ioctl/ioctl-number.txt.


The ioctl-number.txt file lists the magic numbers used throughout the kernel,* so youâ€™ll be able to choose your own magic number and avoid overlaps

The standard talks about the 32-bit command numbers, formed of four components embedded into the [31:0] bits:

The direction of command operation [bits 31:30] -- read, write, both, or none -- filled by the corresponding macro (_IOR, _IOW, _IOWR, _IO).

The size of the command argument [bits 29:16] -- computed using sizeof() with the command argument's type -- the third argument to these macros.

The 8-bit magic number [bits 15:8] -- to render the commands unique enough -- typically an ASCII character (the first argument to these macros).

The original command number [bits 7:0] -- the actual command number (1, 2, 3, ...), defined as per our requirement -- the second argument to these macros.
