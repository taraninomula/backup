# insmod memory.ko
 Itâ€™s also convenient to unprotect the device:


# create a Charater Device File(CDF)
mknod <name_device>  <device_type> <major> <minor>
Example:
mknod /dev/MyCharDevice c 253 15



# chmod 666 /dev/memory
If everything went well, you will have a device /dev/memory to which you can write a string of characters and it will store the last one of them. You can perform the operation like this:

$ echo -n abcdef >/dev/memory
To check the content of the device you can use a simple cat:

$ cat /dev/memory
